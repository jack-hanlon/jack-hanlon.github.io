Jack Hanlon, BSc
Job hunting recent graduate

Iâ€™m a recent graduate of an undergraduate degree in Physics & Computer Science from the University of Victoria. Since graduation I have been working on a project with the Canadian Space Agency on using GPU computing to model subsurface ice detection on Mars using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar. The project was completed successfully, accelerating the model from a 16 hr runtime to 7 seconds using CUDA programming. I am now focused on completing the fastai deep learning course created by Jeremy Howard, whilst looking for roles in the fields I am passionate about - physics, space, AI, and business
