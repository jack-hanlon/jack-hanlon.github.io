Jack Hanlon - B.Sc. Physics & Computer Science


I recently completed a research project with the Canadian Space Agency on using GPU computing to model subsurface ice detection on Mars using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar. The project was completed successfully, accelerating the model from a 16 hr runtime to 7 seconds using CUDA programming.  
  
I am now focused on completing the fastai deep learning course created by Jeremy Howard, practicing leetcode problems, and other side projects.
